Live by Daylight is a one-player top-down view 2d game that the player needs to control P1 to escape from the gate by opening one of the chests on the map. During the gameplay, P2 –– the AI attendant will collaborate with the player by opening chests or kiting the killer. Meanwhile, the AI killer will wander around different areas on the map to find the survivors. After being attacked twice, the survivor will be brought to the jail. And if the survivor is brought to the jail twice, it dies. The game ends if the player escaped or died, but continues even if P2 dies.
From the folder unzipped, start the game by directly running the “main.py” file. To be able to run the animations in this file, pillow must be installed. For shortcuts, pressing the key ‘1’ could directly open the gate by opening chest 1 in the game. The keys ‘r’ and ‘p’ could each restart and pause the game at any time, and pressing ‘b’ and ‘k’ could freeze P2 (survivor B) and the killer respectively.
